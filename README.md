# Syncing Safe with your multisig data

## Option 1 - address book
You can manually download the [address book CSV](address_book.csv) file and import it on the [Safe -Address book](https://app.safe.global/address-book) page.

## Option 2 - browser console
You can also sync by injecting the data directly into your browser's local storage for the [Safe](https://app.safe.global) website.

Open browser console window:
- Chrome/Brave -> "Cmd + Option + J" (on a Mac) or "Ctrl +Shift +J" (on Windows)
- Safari -> "Cmd + Option + C" (on a Mac)
- Firefox -> righ-click on page, select "Inspect", switch to "console" tab

Enter the text from the [console input](console_input.js) file.

### Google Sheets
There is also a private [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DC2oWERbxKXysXBBlSUCK6GmqjEIvEkv9AtXq6YSAn0) that tracks all of the multisig data. Please note, access to this document is only for members of the [holograph.xyz](https://holograph.xyz) organization.
